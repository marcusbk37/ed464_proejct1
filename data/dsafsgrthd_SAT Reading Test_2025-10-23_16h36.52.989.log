The trees, like people, have their individual characters; some were ready to yield up their life-blood, while others were more reluctant. Now one of the birchen basins was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made. From the corners of this chip—at first drop by drop, then more freely—the sap trickled into the little dishes.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?'

According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists\' many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven\'t uncovered a satisfactory explanation.\n\nText 2:\nEcologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton\'s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld\'s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.\n\nBased on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the "conventional wisdom" discussed in Text 1?'
